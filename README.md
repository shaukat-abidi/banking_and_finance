# Machine Learning application in Banking and Finance

Machine learning algorithms are used to address several problems/applications in banking and finance. Thanks to these algorithms, we can now implement models that can perform fraud detection, credit score assignment,  algorithmic trading etc. 

In majority cases, we are required to train machine learning models for **classification** (i.e. predict classes i.e. fraud/no fraud) or **regression** (i.e. predict continuous number for e.g  house prices). More advanced tasks would require the modeling of different variables, time-series modeling and forecasting, and statistical machine learning models to perform the task from probabilistic perspective.  We will see a very simple case of classification on the publicly available dataset.

Once data is at hand, we should go through the following steps:

 1. Data analysis
 2. Data pre-processing
 3. Training ML models followed by Testing phase

Lets try to train a very simple Fraud detection model on financial transaction dataset. We selected public dataset from Kaggle, *[Synthetic Financial Datasets For Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/ntnu-testimon/paysim1)*.
